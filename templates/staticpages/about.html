    <h2> About Munin </h2>
    <p> Munin is a project developed by 4 masters students at NTNU for TDT4140 - Software Development. </p>
    <p> The purpose of the project is revolutionizing the teaching experience at universities around the world, </p>
    <p> and the man responsible for all of this is this man: Pekka Abrahamsson</p>

        <img src="{% static "images/pekka.jpg" %}" alt="Pekka Abrahamsson" style="width:265px;height:265px;">
    </a>
    <p> To achieve this, we decided to create a webpage, the likes of which the world has never seen</p>
    <p> Munin helps students ask questions and get answers from lecturers</p>
    <p> Students enroll in a class and are connected to a subject</p>
    <p> Once there, they may ask questions, and upvote previously asked questions, to let the lecturer know</p>
    <p> what the students want explained. They can also search through already answered questions to get answers.</p>
